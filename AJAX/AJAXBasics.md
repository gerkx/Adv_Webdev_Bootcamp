#APIs don't respond with HTML. APIs responde with pure data, not structure
    * They use more efficient data formats like XML and JSON

# XML is syntacticly similar to HTML, but does not describe  presentation like HTML does
```XML
<pin>
    <title>Title goes here</title>
</pin>
```

#JSON looks almost identical to JS objects:
```javascript
    'pin':{
        'title': 'Blah Blah',
        'author': 'John Doe'
    }
```

# JSON is more commnly uses these days b/c it works well with JS
